Text classification using BiLSTM , CNN-LSTM and Hybrid CNN-BiLSTM models are compared. I was run this project on google collaboratory. Dataset consist of 10 millions of datas but insufficent to RAM capacity only takes 550000 datas handle.Combine Issue and Sub-issue to form the input text used for classification.
BiLSTM model predictions seems to be alligned with expected categories for each complaint, while the CNN-LSTM model seemed to misclassify some complaints
